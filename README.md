Groovy Photo Viewer
===================

This Groovlet was forked from my original 500px-specific project after the 500px API was shut down. The intent is to allow for many different photo sources and those sources will be coming in the near future.

This code will likely evolve and be used, in some form, in a Raspberry Pi photo frame that I plan on building.

The current webserver.groovy file is based heavily on one used in [Groovy in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/groovy-in-action-second-edition).
